README for OSF/1
----------------

libcdaudio has limited and untested support for OSF/1.  Although it may be
able to list the tracks and read the CDDB/CD Index information, playing will
probably fail and stopping will not work at all.

If you are willing to test this on OSF/1, please e-mail me at
bascule@inferno.tusculum.edu.
