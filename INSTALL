Installation Instructions for libcdaudio
----------------------------------------

 If you received libcdaudio as part of a package with something else, 
 then you should go to the top level source directory and read the instructions
 from there.  The instructions in this file are for building libcdaudio as an
 independant package.

Platforms
---------

 libcdaudio will compile under the following platforms.  Listed underneath
 them are any functions that will not work on that platform.

 Linux 1.2
  CD-ROM changer functions will not work at all.

 Linux 2.0
  You may select discs using the cd_changer_select_disc() function, but the
  cd_changer_slots() function will not work at all, and consequently, the
  cd_changer_stat() function will not work as well.
  
 Linux 2.1/2.2/2.3
  All functions should work correctly.

 OpenBSD 2.3 
  The tray open/close functions may not work correctly.
  CD-ROM changer functions will not work at all.

 FreeBSD 3.2
  A kernel bug prevents you from ejecting the tray when 
  there is no disc present.
  CD-ROM changer functions will not work at all.

 Solaris 2.5, 2.6
  The tray open/close functions may not work correctly 
  CD-ROM changer functions will not work at all.
  cd_get_volume() will always return 0 for the volumes.

 Irix
  As far as I know all function work within Irix.

Installation
------------

Step 1.
  Run the configuration script.  This script will sort out any platform
  dependancies and select the appropriate CD-ROM header file for your
  system.  Simply run:

  ./configure

  For systems using a different shell than bash or sh (e.g. csh), you
  will need to run:

  sh ./configure
  
  Be sure to watch what configure says to be sure that it has selected
  everything correctly.

Step 2.
  Run 'make'.  This will build libcdaudio.  If all works correctly both the
  shared and static libraries will be created, and should be located under
  source/.libs

Step 3.
  Run 'make install'.  This will install libcdaudio under /usr/local/lib.
  If /usr/local/lib is not present in your ld.so.conf (usually located under
  /etc/ld.so.conf), you will need to add it.  If you are unable to add it or
  are on a system which does not use ld.so.conf, you will need to add 
  /usr/local/lib to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH when you wish to run libcdaudio
  programs.

Step 4.
  For Linux: If /usr/local/lib is in or has been added to ld.so.conf, you may 
  now run:
 
  ldconfig

  to complete the installation of the library.  If you added /usr/local/lib
  to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH instead, then you do not need to do this.

Step 5. (optional)
  You may now run 'make clean' to delete the object and library files left in
  the source directory.  If you don't have any reason to keep the source,
  you can simply remove the source directory entirely.
