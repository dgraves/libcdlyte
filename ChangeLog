	* Windows support
	* Basic rewrite of the CDDB code, adding full support for data submission through both SMTP and HTTP
	* Changes to internal memory management (no more fixed size arrays for CD info; may address this bug)
	* Removed CDindex support and CD changer support
	* General bug fixes, code reorganization, and simplification
	* Addition of test applications to exercise the CD player and CDDB capability (including SMTP and HTTP emulators for testing CDDB submission support)


Sat,  1 Jan 2000 10:34:43 -0700  Tony Arcieri  <bascule@inferno.tusculum.edu>

	* Solaris fixes.

	* cddb_mc_* class of functions completed.

Wed, 20 Oct 1999 20:58:18 -0600  Tony Arcieri  <bascule@inferno.tusculum.edu>

	* Fixed non-symlink mount checking bug

Thu,  7 Oct 1999 19:58:40 -0600  Tony Arcieri  <bascule@inferno.tusculum.edu>
	
	* Much of cdaudio.c simplified. 

	* Denastified a great deal of code.  Needless static buffers are
	  gone, as are most of the calls to strtok().

Mon, 16 Aug 1999 23:55:10 -0600  Tony Arcieri  <bascule@inferno.tusculum.edu>

	* E-mail submission is pretty nasty, but works somewhat.

	* Cover art lookups were failing.  Fixed.

	* Cover art caching wasn't working correctly.  That is now fixed.

	* Fixed problems for people who are cross-compiling.

	* Fixed a little problem.  FreeBSD and Linux now generate the same
	  CD Index ID.  As to which one had the "correct" TOC data, I don't
	  know, but since the CD Index seems to have started on Linux, I
	  thought I'd go ahead and make FreeBSD generate the same IDs as Linux.

	* Ugh, submission support has gone all to pot.  I'll try to fix this.

	* Well, 0.99.0 didn't work on Irix.  It should now, I hope.
	
	* Ditto for Solaris.

Thu, 29 Jul 1999 10:40:40 -0600  Tony Arcieri  <bascule@inferno.tusculum.edu>
	
	* cd_stat() modularized to use cd_poll() to read the subchannel and
	  cd_update() to update information in a disc_info structure using
	  the data from a disc_status structure.  In this fashion programs
	  which continouosly poll the CD-ROM need not read the TOC every time.

	* Added the cd_poll() function and disc_status structure

	* Added parse_disc_artist and parse_track_artist flags which can
	  disable parsing of the disc title and track title into seperate
	  artist and title fields.

	* Fixed some internal bugs about detecting whether or not a CD is
	  present in the drive

	* cd_playctl() is now the de facto standard for CD play.  All other
	  play functions are now wrappers to it.

	* Since my ~/.cddbrc is conflicting with others, it is now called
	  ~/.cdserverrc.  This also makes since because it's storing CD Index
	  and Cover Art servers now.

	* Changed all my old thinking on cover art storage.  It now uses a
 	  seperate structure.  The old method was based on the idea that the
	  cover art would be stored within a CDDB/CD Index entry itself.  This
	  didn't pan out.

	* Fixed cd_advance() bug where rewind would not function properly.

	* Irix support in libcdaudio added.

	* Began implementing Cover Art support.

	* Majour interface overhauls... but this is it, the final published
	  libcdaudio interface is out.  If there's anything else I want to
	  change, I better have a damn good reason for it.

Fri, 18 Jun 1999 01:04:03 -0600  Tony Arcieri  <bascule@inferno.tusculum.edu>

	* Fixed 64-bit clenliness problems with CDDB IDs.
	
	* Attempted some internal optomisations, which were not entirely
	  successful.

Sat Apr 17 16:49:31 MDT 1999  Tony Arcieri  <tarcieri@gjhsnews.mesa.k12.co.us>

	* Removed the cover art structures from the track structures.

	* Added CD Index support.

	* Added LBA information for each track because it is required to 
	  calculate the CD Index ID.

Fri Apr  9 23:16:53 MDT 1999  Tony Arcieri  <tarcieri@gjhsnews.mesa.k12.co.us>

	* Added structures for the future storage of cover art, as soon as a
	  standard gets worked out for this.  The size is based upon a padded
	  maximum byte value for a 150x150 JPEG.  It may also change.

	* Added cddb_message external variable to store CDDB messages received
	  or other error messages that occoured.

	* Fixed CDDB revision values

	* Renamed track structure under disc_data to data_track to make the
	  naming conventions more consistant.

	* Fixed glibc2.1 snprintf problems.

	* Fixed Solaris compile-time problems.  Some run-time problems still 
	  exist.

Thu Feb 18 22:07:45 MST 1999  Tony Arcieri  <tarcieri@gjhsnews.mesa.k12.co.us>

	* Fixed track_type to reflect if a track is truly an audio or data
	  track.

	* Fixed some bugs in data.c which cause extended data to be truncated

	* CDDB submission support added, currently set to 'test' mode until
	  libcdaudio is certified

	* Fixed a problem with cd_changer_stat's formatting of disc_info

Sun Jan 31 21:09:14 MST 1999  Tony Arcieri  <tarcieri@gjhsnews.mesa.k12.co.us>

	* Due to an apparent bug in the new kernel interface, the old, ugly
	  method of detecting if there is no disc in the CD-ROM is used

	* Applications should no longer use the "getserver" method of locating
	  a server.  The entire server list may be obtained via the
	  cddb_read_serverlist function.  To refresh the serverlist, use
	  the cddb_sites function to obtain the list, and cddb_write_serverlist
	  to write it.

	* All previous configuration functions eliminated, new class
	  implemented.  cddb_read_serverlist and cddb_write_serverlist
	  added to deal with new ~/.cddbrc format.  Server names are now
	  stored as URLs.  cddb_process_url implemented to process URLs.

	* cddb_query now takes the HTTP string from cddb_connect_server when
	  the HTTP method is used.

	* cddb_connect_server, cddb_query, cddb_read, and cddb_sites now take
	  variable arguements.  When used in HTTP mode, cddb_connect_server
	  takes char *http_string and int http_string_len.  All the latter take
	  the http_string produced by cddb_connect_server at the end.
  
	* cddb_connect_server combined with cddb_hello to produce a single
	  function.

	* Merged libcdaudio 0.5.2 with Mike Oliphant's libcdaudio 0.6.0.
	  Now supports HTTP method of CDDB access, and level 3 of the CDDB
	  protocol.

1999-01-18  Mike Oliphant  <oliphant@ling.ed.ac.uk>

        * fixed problem with snprintf() not liking src & dest to be the
          same

        * fixed problems handling albums without titles

        * switched code to use http instead of the (now deprecated) cddb
          (note: this involves non-backward compatible changes)

Sat Sep 26 21:05:05 MDT 1998  Tony Arcieri  <bascule@procyon.mesa.k12.co.us>

	* Fixed a formatting data formatting problem that was causing
	  quite a bit of trouble. 

	* cd_init changed to cd_init_device for better standardization across
          all of libaudio. 

Thu Aug 27 21:44:18 MDT 1998  Tony Arcieri  <bascule@procyon.mesa.k12.co.us>

	* Added cddb_stat_disc_data, which client-side CDDB operations would
	  call before invoking cddb_read_disc_data in order to keep it from
	  performing automated CDDB lookups, similar to one calling select
	  before reading from a descriptor that blocks.   

	* Portability #defines improved for more flexibility.  libcdaudio works
          under Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and Solaris.

	* Vastly improved CDDB command set, especially the query command.  The
	  CDDB command set is no longer static, allowing programmers to call
	  the functions directly.

	* Fixed buffer overflows in data.c modifications... *grin*... this was
	  done pre-release so I guess it's okay...

	* Massive internal changes across the board, designed to fix many
	  bugs and other oddities that people were complaining about.

	* Ignore that last comment.  libcdaudio compiles under FreeBSD.  Now I
	  discover that there are multiple forms of sys/cdio.h, so everything
	  gets a heck of a lot more complicated now.

	* Added a whole bunch of stuff for sys/cdio.h, hoping to get libcdaudio
	  to compile under FreeBSD.  If anybody manages to compile it under
	  FreeBSD be sure to tell me.

	* struct disc_data changes again, for the last time... I promise!

	* data.c is much bigger, and much more important.  User level programs
	  now get preformatted everything, including extended data.

	* Found that all CDDB entries can be multi-line when listening to
	  "Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave
	  and Grooving with a Pict."  Changed the way the cddb code processes
	  entries to include a proto-data storage structure and a final data
	  storage structure.

	* Started working on FreeBSD support

	* Whoops!  The mount checking didn't exactly work if the device given
	  is a symlink (which cdcd does).  Fixed that.

	* cd_play_track_pos endtrack function fixed (I'm gonna rewrite that
	  screwey function anyway)

Sun Aug  1 16:20:05 MDT 1998  Tony Arcieri  <bascule@inferno.tusculum.edu>

	* CDDB server list functions implemented

	* Volume functions changed to use a structure

	* track_pos now replaces old track_length

	* cd_get_volume implemented

	* Experimenting with CD changer support 

	* track_length fixed, to produce individual track lengths

Mon Jul 27 23:27:03 MDT 1998  Tony Arcieri  <bascule@procyon.mesa.k12.co.us>

	* Package now configured with autoconf, to avoid all those nasty
	  problems people have been reporting with installation

	* Added data.c, with functions to work with track information

	* Added support for extended track information

	* Fixed genre bug in cd_read_disc_data (cddb_read_data_local) 

Thu Jul 23 00:15:33 MDT 1998  Tony Arcieri  <bascule@procyon.mesa.k12.co.us>

	* True CDDB-style local databasing system implemented, compatible with
	  XFreeCd.

	* trackinfo.c eliminated.  Here ends the old track database system.

Wed Jul 22 12:35:04 MDT 1998  Tony Arcieri  <bascule@procyon.mesa.k12.co.us>

	* CDDB support functional.

Mon Jul 20 01:02:23 MDT 1998  Tony Arcieri  <bascule@procyon.mesa.k12.co.us>

	* cdcd and libcdaudio seperated.

	* Work on cdda reading implementation suspended until cddb support is 
	  completed.

	* Started implementing CDDB support.

Thu Jul  9 02:29:20 MDT 1998  Tony Arcieri  <bascule@procyon.mesa.k12.co.us>

	* Started implementing cdda reader.

	* Added digital volume control.

	* Added track positioning system (cd_advance).

	* make install works now.

Tue Jul  7 10:31:56 MDT 1998  Tony Arcieri  <bascule@procyon.mesa.k12.co.us>

	* cdcd now supports track name databases.

	* Added some prototypes in the include file... whoops.

	* Eliminated disc_info section of play function, fixing disc change
	  problem.

	* Eliminated disc_zero function in favour of reading CD header every
	  time.
	
	* Experimenting with track name databases.

Sun Jul  5 14:40:41 MDT 1998  Tony Arcieri  <bascule@procyon.mesa.k12.co.us>

	* Started ChangeLog.
