General Information
-------------------
 libcdlyte is a portable C library designed to provide functions to control
 operation of a CD-ROM when playing audio CDs.  It also provides functions
 for retrieving CD information from CDDB compatible services.

 It is a fork of version 0.99.4 of the libcdaudio library by Tony Arcieri,
 and was developed for use with the fxcd portable CD player application.
 Modifications include:
 * Support for Microsoft Windows
 * Rewrite of CDDB code with full SMTP and HTTP submission capability
 * New memory management model (no more fixed size arrays for CD info)
 * Addition of test programs to exercise the CD and CDDB capability (including
   SMTP and HTTP emulators for testing CDDB submission capability)
 
 libcdlyte should continue to work with all operating systems supported by 
 libcdaudio, with the addition of support for Microsoft Windows.  It continues 
 to be licensed with the GNU LGPL v2 license.
 
 What follows is the content of the original libcdaudio
 README file (with the libcdaudio name replaced with libcdlyte):
